Warpgate is a smart & fully transparent SSH, HTTPS, MySQL and PostgreSQL bastion host that doesn't require a client app or an SSH wrapper.

- Set it up in your DMZ, add user accounts and easily assign them to specific hosts and URLs within the network.
- Warpgate will record every session for you to view (live) and replay later through a built-in admin web UI.
- Not a jump host - forwards connection straight to the target in a way that's fully transparent to the client.
- Native 2FA and SSO support (TOTP & OpenID Connect)
- Single binary with no dependencies.
- Written in 100% safe Rust.
